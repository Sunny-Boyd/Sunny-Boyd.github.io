<p style="text-align: center;">I am a fan of light novels and crime shows. I'm currently reading 13 different light novels and my current favorite three are:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Peddler in Another World" href="https://j-novel.club/series/peddler-in-another-world"><strong>Peddler in Another World: I can go back whenever I want!</strong></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">After quitting his job at a toxic company, Shiro Amata moves into the house his grandmother left him in her will. <br />There, he soon makes two life-changing discoveries: one, his grandmother was really a witch from another world, and two, said other world is just on the other side of her closet door! <br />Thanks to a book she left for Shiro, he also manages to obtain an all-powerful skill called &ldquo;Equivalent Exchange,&rdquo; which allows him to turn money from his world into otherworldly currency and vice versa.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Campfire Cooking in Another World" href="https://j-novel.club/series/campfire-cooking-in-another-world-with-my-absurd-skill"><strong>Campfire Cooking in Another World With My Absurd Skill</strong></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Mukouda Tsuyoshi was nothing special in modern Japan, so when he was summoned to a world of swordplay and sorcery, he thought he was ready for the adventure of a lifetime. <br />Too bad the kingdom that summoned him only got him by mistake! Not only was he not one of the three summoned heroes, but his stats were laughable compared to theirs. <br />On top of that, there's something really sketchy about this kingdom... &nbsp;The only thing Mukouda can rely on is his unique skill: the "Online Supermarket," a skill that allows him to buy modern goods in a fantasy world. <br />It's useless for combat, but if he plays his cards right, he could lead a comfortable life, maybe?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="I Parry Everything" href="https://j-novel.club/series/i-parry-everything"><strong>I Parry Everything: What Do You Mean I'm the Strongest? I'm Not Even An Adventurer Yet!</strong></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The Kingdom of Clays faces a dire crisis: an assassination attempt has just been made on its own Princess Lynneburg, and its neighboring countries eye the aftermath like starving vultures, plotting the Kingdom&rsquo;s downfall. <br />The ensuing conflict will shape the face of the continent for centuries to come...but Noor doesn&rsquo;t have a clue about any of that!<br /> Having freshly arrived at the royal capital after over a decade of rigorous, isolated training at his mountain home, he&rsquo;s dead set on achieving his childhood dream of becoming an adventurer, even if the only skills he possesses are useless ones.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">From the titles, you might be able to tell that I like the fantasy genre of books, and that would be correct. I like fantasty, adventure, isekai, and action. I linked the site that I normally read from for each book.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the current tv shows I am watching, it would be:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.cbs.com/shows/swat/">S.W.A.T. On CBS/ParamountPlus</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.cbs.com/shows/fbi/">FBI&nbsp;On CBS/ParamountPlus</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/">And whichever anime is interesting to me at the time, on Crunchyroll.</a></li>
</ul>
